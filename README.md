# TimeGuardian
This software package tracks code execution time, alerting users when operations exceed set time limits. It supports customizable thresholds for functions, lines, or the whole app. Alerts for crossed thresholds are sent via terminal, email, or phone, helping identify and fix performance issues in code. Can be use for debugging and for production.
